# HeLog API

This project is a cookie-based authentication and API server built with Express. Hosted on Fly.io.

The server uses Mongoose to build data models and query data and uses the MongoDB database to store data.

## Technologies:

1. [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) uses Google and Facebook for social authentication.

2. [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to build all data models and perform CRUD operations of account, user and post.

## Additional info:

-   This project consists of a backend for API and two different front-ends for accessing and editing blog posts.

-   The backend's authentication is cookie-based to prevent the need to log in again when switching between two different front-ends.

-   In the future, I plan to add email and password authentication to the backend for users to have more ways to sign up.
